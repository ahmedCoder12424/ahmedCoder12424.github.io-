<h2>CSE 110 Project: TritonMates </h2>

<p>This was the major group project for CSE 110: Software Engineering Course. We created a web-app for roommates 
where we implemented a points system where users can unlock fun avatars upon completing tasks. This was done 
to incentivize good behavior. Moreover, our app has a wizard to report serious conflicts with a step by step 
process to descalate tensions and encourage constructive feedback. Lastly, we have an events component to
improve roomamte cohesion.I worked extensively on the firebase backend particularly on creating and integrating 
the backend functions for the task components, the wizard to report conflicts, and the backend for the user profile 
and points.</p>

<h2>CSE 151A Project: Problematic Internet Use Predictor</h2>

<p>This project from my CSE151A Machine Learning Course uses the Kaggle dataset provided by the Child Mind Institute - https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/child-mind-institute-problematic-internet-use/overview. The project centers around predicting whether or not a child has problematic internet use. To be more specific, the model will predict a person’s Severity Impairment Index (SII), an integer from 0 to 3, which is a number established by the Child Mind Institute to measure how excessive a person’s internet use is. The prediction will be based on multiple different measured information about the participant; features include demographics, physical measurements, fitness gram tests, and other assessment scores.
We chose this topic because it tackles a highly relevant issue in today’s world, where constant internet activity has become deeply entrenched in daily life, often accompanied by reported mental health challenges, and thus many people may connect with this project and find the implications interesting or insightful as a result. A lot of times, you might hear about “iPad kids” that are always impulsively watching something on their electronic devices rather than engaging with the physical world, so it would be really cool if we could somehow classify problematic behavior, so that such behavior could be addressed early on.
In particular, having a good predictive model of one’s SII based on several of their individual activities or attributes provides good insight into what combination of features is most associated with internet-related mental health challenges, and this information could be distributed to the general public, helping parents guide their children to adopting better lifestyle choices and habits and being more self-aware. Additionally, if a good predictive model is actually deployed, then perhaps parents could make use of the model as a check to the severity of their child’s internet use, and then use that information to make changes that steer the child away from their devices.
In the context of ML and our learning experience, this project was also very interesting in that the structure of the data as originally presented was very complex and even unusual; a lot of the data was actually missing values, which makes a little sense if you consider that some of the children participants were able to participate more than others (a 5 year old will be able to participate in less tests than a 12 year old, for instance).</p>

<h2>IEEE Project</h2>
<p><a href = "https://github.com/ahmedCoder12424/NEMO">https://github.com/ahmedCoder12424/NEMO</a></p>
<p>In this group project for UCSD IEEE club, we built a flask based app displaying all current campus events in a single unified environment.
We utilized selenium to scrape club instagrams with Jupyter Notebook Python scripts. </p>
